# AI TOOLKIT

The AI TOOLKIT is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Why use the AI TOOLKIT?

Integrating large language models (LLMs) into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI TOOLKIT standardizes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models across [supported providers](/docs/foundations/providers-and-models). This enables developers to focus on building great AI applications, not waste time on technical details.

For example, hereâ€™s how you can generate text with various models using the AI TOOLKIT:

<PreviewSwitchProviders />

The AI TOOLKIT has two main libraries:

- **[AI TOOLKIT Core](/docs/ai-toolkit-core):** A unified API for generating text, structured objects, tool calls, and building agents with LLMs.
- **[AI TOOLKIT UI](/docs/ai-toolkit-ui):** A set of framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interface.

## Model Providers

The AI TOOLKIT supports [multiple model providers](/providers).

## Templates

We've built some [templates](https://vercel.com/templates?type=ai) that include AI TOOLKIT integrations for different use cases, providers, and frameworks. You can use these templates to get started with your AI-powered application.

### Starter Kits

<Templates type="starter-kits" />

### Feature Exploration

<Templates type="feature-exploration" />

### Frameworks

<Templates type="frameworks" />

### Generative UI

<Templates type="generative-ui" />

### Security

<Templates type="security" />

## Join our Community

If you have questions about anything related to the AI TOOLKIT, you're always welcome to ask our community on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/khulnasoft/ai/discussions).

## `llms.txt` (for Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude etc.)

You can access the entire AI TOOLKIT documentation in Markdown format at [sdk.khulnasoft.com/llms.txt](/llms.txt). This can be used to ask any LLM (assuming it has a big enough context window) questions about the AI TOOLKIT based on the most up-to-date documentation.

### Example Usage

For instance, to prompt an LLM with questions about the AI TOOLKIT:

1. Copy the documentation contents from [sdk.khulnasoft.com/llms.txt](/llms.txt)
2. Use the following prompt format:

```prompt
Documentation:
{paste documentation here}
---
Based on the above documentation, answer the following:
{your question}
```
