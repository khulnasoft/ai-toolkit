# Unsupported model version error

## Issue

When migrating to AI TOOLKIT 5, you might encounter an error stating that your model uses an unsupported version:

```
AI_UnsupportedModelVersionError: Unsupported model version v1 for provider "ollama.chat" and model "gamma3:4b".
AI TOOLKIT 5 only supports models that implement specification version "v2".
```

This error occurs because the version of the provider package you're using implements the older (v1) model specification.

## Background

AI TOOLKIT 5 requires all provider packages to implement specification version "v2". When you upgrade to AI TOOLKIT 5 but don't update your provider packages to compatible versions, they continue using the older "v1" specification, causing this error.

## Solution

### Update provider packages to AI TOOLKIT 5 compatible versions

Update all your `@ai-toolkit/*` provider packages to compatible version `2.0.0` or later. These versions implement the v2 specification required by AI TOOLKIT 5.

```bash
pnpm install ai@latest @ai-toolkit/openai@latest @ai-toolkit/anthropic@latest
```

For AI TOOLKIT 5 compatibility, you need:

- `ai` package: `5.0.0` or later
- `@ai-toolkit/*` packages: `2.0.0` or later (for example, `@ai-toolkit/openai`, `@ai-toolkit/anthropic`, `@ai-toolkit/google`)
- `@ai-toolkit/provider` package: `2.0.0` or later
- `zod` package: `4.1.8` or later

### Check provider compatibility

If you're using a third-party or custom provider, verify that it has been updated to support AI TOOLKIT 5. Not all providers may have v2-compatible versions available yet.

To check if a provider supports AI TOOLKIT 5:

1. Check the provider's package.json for `@ai-toolkit/provider` peer dependency version `2.0.0` or later
2. Review the provider's changelog or migration guide
3. Check the provider's repository for AI TOOLKIT 5 support

For more information on migrating to AI TOOLKIT 5, see the [AI TOOLKIT 5.0 migration guide](/docs/migration-guides/migration-guide-5-0).
