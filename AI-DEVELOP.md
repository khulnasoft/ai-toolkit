# AI Development Plan: dev-ai & micro-ai

## Working Process

### 1. Requirements & Architecture
- Define main features for both dev-ai and micro-ai.
- Choose tech stack (e.g., TypeScript/Node.js, React, etc.).
- Plan integration and shared components.

### 2. dev-ai: Developer Improvement Toolkit
- Scaffold frontend (React/Vite or Next.js).
- Scaffold backend (Node.js/Express/Fastify).
- Implement real-time communication (WebSockets, Socket.IO).
- Integrate with AI provider APIs for developer suggestions and analysis.
- Build developer dashboard (usage stats, error tracking, suggestions).

### 3. micro-ai: AI Provider Data Analysis & Agentic System
- Scaffold backend for data ingestion and agent logic.
- Set up real-time data pipelines (WebSockets, message queues).
- Build frontend dashboard for monitoring and controlling agents.
- Implement agentic logic (autonomous workflows, triggers, alerts).
- Connect to multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

### 4. Shared/Integration
- Implement shared authentication/authorization.
- Create shared UI components or libraries.
- Define and implement API contracts between dev-ai and micro-ai.

### 5. Real-Time & Agentic Features
- Use WebSockets or server-sent events for real-time updates.
- Implement agent framework for autonomous actions.
- Enable both projects to send/receive real-time data.

### 6. Data Analysis
- Set up data storage (database, time-series DB, etc.).
- Implement analytics pipelines (ETL, aggregation, visualization).
- Integrate with AI provider APIs for data fetching and analysis.

### 7. Testing & Deployment
- Write unit and integration tests.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines.
- Deploy to staging/production environments.

_This process ensures a structured workflow for building, integrating, and deploying dev-ai and micro-ai with real-time, agentic, and data analysis capabilities._

## TODO List: micro-agent & dev-ai Integration

1. **Define Integration Architecture**
   - [ ] Specify communication method (API, WebSocket, message bus, etc.)
   - [ ] Document shared data structures and events

2. **Enhance micro-agent for Real-Time & Agentic Features**
   - [ ] Add event emitters or WebSocket server to micro-agent for real-time status updates
   - [ ] Implement hooks/APIs for external triggers (from dev-ai)
   - [ ] Expand agent logic for autonomous code improvement and feedback loops

3. **Data Analysis & Provider Insights**
   - [ ] Implement logging of agent actions, LLM usage, and test results in micro-agent
   - [ ] Create endpoints or data export for dev-ai to access analytics
   - [ ] Aggregate and analyze provider performance and agent effectiveness

4. **Build dev-ai Dashboard**
   - [ ] Scaffold dashboard UI (React/Vite or Next.js)
   - [ ] Display real-time agent activity, code/test results, and provider stats
   - [ ] Add visualizations for analytics and actionable insights

5. **Testing & Feedback Loop**
   - [ ] Write integration tests for micro-agent and dev-ai communication
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD to run both unit and integration tests

6. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update AI-DEVELOP.md with integration steps, API/event docs, and usage examples
   - [ ] Add READMEs to both packages for setup and contribution guidelines
