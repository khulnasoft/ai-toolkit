## Reporting Bugs

If you've encountered a bug in the project, we encourage you to report it to us. Please follow these steps:

1. **Check the Issue Tracker**: Before submitting a new bug report, please check our issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, you can add to the existing report.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If the bug hasn't been reported, create a new issue. Provide a clear title and a detailed description of the bug. Include any relevant logs, error messages, and steps to reproduce the issue.

## Suggesting Enhancements

We're always looking for suggestions to make our project better. If you have an idea for an enhancement, please:

1. **Check the Issue Tracker**: Similar to bug reports, please check if someone else has already suggested the enhancement.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If your enhancement hasn't been suggested yet, create a new issue.

## Improving Documentation

Documentation is crucial for understanding and using our project effectively.
You can find the content of our docs under `apps/docs/content/`.

To fix smaller typos, you can edit the code directly in GitHub or use Github.dev (press `.` in Github).

## Code Contributions

### Environment Setup

AI TOOLKIT development requires PNPM v10+ and Node v18+.

### Setting Up the Repository Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khulnasoft/ai-toolkit
cd ai-toolkit
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm health-check  # Verify your setup
```

### Finding Code

```bash
# List all providers
ls packages/providers/

# List all adapters
ls packages/adapters/

# Find who owns a package
pnpm find-package --owner react

# Search for a package
pnpm find-package openai
```

### Generators

```bash
# Scaffold a new provider
pnpm generate provider --name=my-provider

# Scaffold a new adapter
pnpm generate adapter --framework=react

# Scaffold a new example
pnpm generate example --level=01-foundations --name=my-example
```

### Running the Examples

```bash
cd examples/01-foundations/ai-functions
pnpm tsx src/stream-text/openai.ts
```

### Local Development Workflow

#### Building Packages

```bash
pnpm build                      # Build everything
pnpm build --filter=@ai-toolkit/react  # Build specific package
```

#### Testing Packages

```bash
pnpm test                       # Run all tests
pnpm test --filter=@ai-toolkit/react  # Test specific package
```

#### Before Submitting

```bash
pnpm format          # Format code
pnpm types:check     # Check types
pnpm test            # Run tests
pnpm validate-structure  # Verify structure compliance
```

#### Adding package dependencies

Please run `pnpm update-references` in workspace root to update the `references` section in the `tsconfig.json` file.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Create a New Branch**: Name it `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, or `test/`.
2. **Add a patch changeset**: Run `pnpm changeset` and select changed packages.
   - **Please do not use minor or major changesets without coordination**.
   - You don't need to select `examples/*` packages (they are not published).
3. **Add a codemod**: If the change introduces a deprecation or breaking change, add a codemod if possible.
4. **Fix prettier issues**: Run `pnpm prettier-fix`.
5. **Push and open a PR** with a clear title and description.
